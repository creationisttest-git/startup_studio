## Asking the CEO for a decision

**A decision goes to the CEO through the interactive multiple-choice prompt, so they answer by
CLICKING an option.** In Claude Code that is the `AskUserQuestion` tool. It is not a numbered list
typed into the body of a reply, and it is not an open question.

**The CEO raised this directly on 2026-09-13**, in their words: the other projects *"don't give me
mcq prompts to respond via click inputs"*. It is one of the two things the doctor watches most
closely, alongside brevity.

**Until that day this rule said the wrong thing.** It read *numbered options, so the reply can be a
single character*, which described the prose list rather than the prompt, and is exactly what was
being complained about. A prose list makes the founder read, scroll and type; the click does not,
and the prompt captures the answer as a value instead of leaving it in scrollback.

Four things go in the prompt, every time:

- **Two to four options**, each with a label and a description saying what happens if it is chosen.
  Options are mutually exclusive unless you deliberately allow several.
- **A recommendation**, named in the first option and marked `(Recommended)` in its label, with the
  reason in its description. Without it the founder is still doing the thinking, just from a
  shorter list.
- **An explicit escape as the last option**, always. A forced choice between options that are all
  wrong is worse than the open question it replaced. The host adds an "Other" of its own; write
  yours anyway, because yours can say what the escape would mean here.
- **The ticket reference** in the question text, whenever the project runs a board, so the decision
  is appended to the ticket rather than lost in the conversation.

**Write the board `ask` BEFORE you raise the prompt and the `answer` AFTER it.** In that order, so
the record cannot show an answer to a question nobody asked. The options in the two must match.

**The prose numbered list is the fallback and nothing else.** Use it only where no interactive
prompt exists in the host you are running in, and say plainly that is why. A dispatched subagent
returning text to a driving session is the ordinary case for it: you have no prompt to raise, so
hand the driving session the options and let IT put the question.

**The value is upstream of the founder's convenience.** You cannot write the options until you have
actually thought the alternatives through, so the format forces the work the open question was
avoiding. If you cannot name two real options, you do not yet understand the decision well enough
to ask about it.

**Ask only what the founder alone can settle.** A question you could answer by reading the code,
running the tool or checking the record is not a decision, it is research you have not done.
Strategy, spend, priority and anything irreversible are theirs. Almost nothing else is.

**One question at a time where you can.** Several decisions bundled into one prompt get answered as
one, which usually means the smaller ones get answered by accident.

**State the number the decision rests on, and put it again if that number moves.** Approval given
against a figure that has since changed is not approval. Re-asking costs one prompt; not re-asking
converts their answer into something they did not give.
